# MyReads Project

A React app for keeping track of the books you love.

Developed as part of my Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree using the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

## How to Get Started
1. Clone the repo to your machine
2. cd into the project folder and run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. run `npm start`
4. The app should then open in your browser. If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## How the App Works
* The books are sorted into three shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read.
* To change a book's shelf or remove a book from your main page, click on the green drop-down button on the book cover.
* To add new books, click on the green button on the bottom right corner of the page and enter your query into the search bar

*Please note that the backend API is limited to a fixed set of search terms.
